# Automated Assignment Completion System

This Python program automates the process of completing school programming assignments by using web scraping techniques and the Edge browser driver. It consists of three main components: accessing the assignment website, querying AI sites for solutions, and submitting answers to the assignment site for validation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **core/**: Contains the core components that implement the main functionality:
  - **Access**: Visits the assignment website and retrieves the task description.
  - **Query**: Uses the task description to search AI websites and extract solutions.
  - **Submit**: Submits the solution to the original assignment website and checks if the solution is correct.

- **tools/**: Contains auxiliary utilities used throughout the program, including:
  - **Timing**: Tracks the time taken for different steps.
  - **Plotting**: Generates visualizations for analysis.
  - **Data Processing**: Helps format and handle any required data for submissions.

- **script.py**: The main program entry point:
  - Can be executed with or without command-line arguments.
  - Supports both testing and running modes, which can be switched using parameters.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Edge browser (with corresponding WebDriver installed)
- Required Python packages:
  - `requests`
  - `selenium`
  - `matplotlib` (for plotting)
  - `seaborn` 
  - `pyperclip` (for copying data to clipboard)
  - `pandas` 
  - Any other dependencies you may need (use `requirements.txt` if applicable)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure that you have the Edge WebDriver installed and configured on your system.

## Usage

### Running the Program

To run the script directly (with default parameters):

```bash
python script.py
```

To run with custom parameters:

```bash
python scriptpy --url <assignment_url> --ai <ai_url> --mode <run_mode>
```

### Modes

- **Test Mode**: Runs tests to verify the core components work properly.
- **Run Mode**: Executes the full process of accessing the assignment, querying for solutions, and submitting answers.
